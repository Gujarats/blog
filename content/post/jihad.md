I've seen a lot of people died 

I've seen a lot of poeple suffer from hunger 

I've seen corruption in many country and region

A baby left behind cried because of the mother died from gun shot

A child shout out loud and crying asking for food and shelter

Corruption caused by human like world of war I, world war II.bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 9/11 suicide plane attack and many others.

Blood and corruption everywhere.

I pray : 

    O God please save everyone !!!

    O God please make us unite !!!

    O God help the poor from hunger !!!

    O God stop the war !!!

    O God stop any evil deed !!!

But still everyone dies, everyone separated with their own opinion, a lot of poor people suffer from hunger, the war happens, and evil deed exist !!!.

There is no way You create the place like this !!!.

O God I don't believe you anymore, You are not exist !!!.

Simple conclusion with simple logic.


















## Why ????

If you read this then you wanted to know more about the "why" : 

 - Why God create this place (Earth) ?
 
   - People here are dying and there is always war in here

   - Blood spilled everywhere

   - Corruption

   - etc

The similar question was asked by the `angels` the pure being that always do what God says.

SAHIH INTERNATIONAL

```
And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority." 
They said, "Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?" 
Allah said, "Indeed, I know that which you do not know."
