      <description>Please make your self comfortable to read other people&amp;rsquo;s code, because it is going to be your daily life as a programmer. Make it as the journer to the wonderful land, and take your time don&amp;rsquo;t rush and understand and try it out.
Maybe this is sounds ridiculous if I say reading other people&amp;rsquo;s code is fun, in fact it is hard to read the code that written by other.</description>

      <description>I have been in various type of companies from early start-up, mid-start-up, and big company. And doing some freelance jobs. Doing some front-end and back-end jobs. It is very exciting journey and yet chalengging and also painful.
How I felt to be Software Developer in the industry My honest opinion when become a Software Developer is I don&amp;rsquo;t have a life like my friends do who are pursuing different career like Lawyer, Accountant, Doctor, Teacher.</description>
