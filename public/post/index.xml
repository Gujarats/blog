      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of people died
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of poeple suffer from hunger
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen corruption in many country and region
A baby left behind cried because of the mother died from gun shot
A child shout out loud and crying asking for food and shelter
Corruption caused by human like world of war I, world war II.bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 9&amp;frasl;11 suicide plane attack and many others.</description>

Maybe this is sounds ridiculous if I say reading other people&amp;rsquo;s code is fun, in fact it is hard to read the code that written by other.</description>
